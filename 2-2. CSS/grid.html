        <div> provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple
            web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
            complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
            improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</div>
